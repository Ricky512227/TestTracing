		1. Get the namespace from the arguement.
    	2. Get the pod from the arguement to capture trace. 
    	3. Check the namespace exists in the cluster.
    	4. Check the deployments of the pod exists in the namespace.
    	5. Check the readiness and liveness 
    	6. Calculate the number of Process inside the mcc platform for the required process.
    
    Record the start timestamp of execution also record the  currnet timestamp of the pod
